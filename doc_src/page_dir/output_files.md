## Output Files

This section describes the gridded netCDF files and ASCII log files
generated by SWB during a simulation run.

### netCDF Files

Primary water-budget variables and other important variables are written
to individual netCDF files. These variables are listed in table 2-4. The
filenames include the variable name, the time range in years, and the
dimensions of the grid. For example, the output filename for the
rainfall variable for a model run that spans from 2013 to 2014 and
covers a model domain of 346 rows by 400 columns would be named
"rainfall_2013_2014__346_by_400.nc." Because of the efficiency
of the underlying netCDF library, writing out netCDF files with SWB is
still several times faster than writing to the custom binary files of
SWB version 1.0.

**Table 1.** List of variables written to separate netCDF
files.

| Variable name                | Units                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

netCDF files hold information about one or more variables as well as metadata about the conditions under which these variable values were generated. The metadata for the snowfall variable generated by SWB are shown in figure 1. The file holds daily SWB output for snowfall, along with projected and geographic spatial coordinates and detailed information about the cartographic projection associated with the projected coordinates. In addition, details about the version of the SWB code used to generate those values are recorded to assist in future data archiving.

    output netCDF file.

### Log Files

In addition to the gridded netCDF output files, SWB writes ASCII log files each time the code is run. If the user experiences an issue while running the code, the first response should be to examine the end of the log file. Often an important error or warning message will be printed to the log file just before the SWB run fails. A small subset of a SWB run log is shown in figure 2.

**Figure 2.**  Subset of a Soil-Water-Balance (SWB) log file as displayed in a
    Markdown editor.

The log files are formatted as Markdown text files; Markdown is a set of text file conventions that can be used to produce HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Portable Document Format (PDF), or other formatted output (Gruber, 2012). The log files are not required to be viewed in a Markdown editor; the files are accessible as plain text and may be viewed in any standard text editor. However, Markdown tags have been selected so that error messages are more easily recognized within the voluminous text of the logfile output.

Many warning messages about missing data will be found in a typical logfile. SWB will print warnings for each data type that does not have an existing file, even if the file is not needed given the simulation options the user has selected. These warnings are safely ignored, but might be useful if SWB reports missing datasets when the user believes the datesets have been properly specified.
